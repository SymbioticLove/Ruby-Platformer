<h1>A Platformer Made Using Ruby and the Gosu Framework</h1>
This is an ongoing side project to make a simple platformer in Ruby's Gosu framework. Our main focus is on our text adventure hosted at https://github.com/SymbioticLove/Mother, and most of
our time is focused there for game development.

Feel free to use this basis for any Ruby platformer. It is currently a simple script that creates a window with a platform across the bottom and a player represented by a green box. The logic for using the arrow keys to move and jump is already programmed as well. We will elaborate on this in our own way here as time goes on. We'd love to see where you go with it!
